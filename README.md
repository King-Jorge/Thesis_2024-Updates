# Thesis_2024-Updates
This repository contains all project files and updates.

# File Update 1:
This file contains the model formulations and PMP statements. I am not able to provide detailed proof of the PMP due to the complexity of proving it. 
Notwithstanding, I have provided an elementary theorem and proof of the PMP. Reference is given to the original work of Pontryagin for the statement and proof of the theorem.

The general problem of the control model is provided. Theorems and proofs of Problem 1 - (Isolation-only model) are included in this file.

# File Update 2:
This document is a continuation of file 1. I have included the formulation of Problem 2 (The travel restrictions-only model) and Problem 3 (The mixed policy model).
The theorems for these problems follow that in Hansen and Day. The proofs are a little bit different due to the model modification and assumptions. 
However, I followed the procedure Hansen and Day used to achieve a conclusion on the proofs.
